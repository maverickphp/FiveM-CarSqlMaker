# FiveM-CarSqlQueryMaker

<h3>YTD File Uploader</h3>
This Python program uploads a file .ytd, copies multiple names, and adds them to a SQL file. It finds the names with the .ytd format from the folder and removes the .ytd extension when writing the names to the SQL query. It also excludes any names that contain +h1 in them and formats the code to make it more readable.
